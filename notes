Command I'm using:

```
rm Gemfile.lock; bundle && be rspec --seed 60017 spec/generators/dashboard_generator_spec.rb:30 spec/generators/routes_generator_spec.rb:121
```

Different error:

```
An error occurred while loading ./spec/generators/dashboard_generator_spec.rb.

I'm going to label this `bisect bad` and see.
If this doesn't help, I'll return here and try `bisect good`.

    Fix DescendantTracker.clear on Ruby 3.1

    Previously I assumed it was useless, however I was wrong.

    The method is called by the reloader to give the illusion that
    the GC is precise. Meaning a class that will be unloaded is
    immediately made invisible without waiting for it to be garbage collected.

    This is easy to do up to Ruby 3.0 because `DescendantTracker` keeps
    a map of all tracked classes.

    However on 3.1 we need to use the inverse strategy, we keep a WeakMap
    of all the classes we cleared, and we filter the return value of `descendants`
    and `subclasses`.

    Since `clear` is private API and is only used when reloading is enabled,
    to reduce the performance impact in production mode, we entirely remove
    this behavior when `config.cache_classes` is enabled.

It does looks like it would be related to our problem too.
